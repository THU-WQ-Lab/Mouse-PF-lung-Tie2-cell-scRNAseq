Trajectory Modeling of Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition Reveals Galectin-3 as a Mediator in Pulmonary Fibrosis

Abstract:
Tie2-creER/+: Rosa26-tdTomato/+ C57BL/6 mice were subjected to intra-trochlear injection of bleomycin(BLM) to induce pulmonary fibrosis, or saline  as control. On day 7 after the injection, mice were sacrificed for lung tissue harvesting. The enzyme-digested tissue samples were then processed through flow cytometry to sort tdTomato+(Tie2+) endothelial cells (ECs). Single-cell RNA seq (scRNA-seq) of BLM- or PBS- treated mice lung ECs was performed to discover the molecular mechanisms behind endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) in lung fibrosis. Pseudotemporal trajectory analysis revealed that Lgals3 (galectin-3), C3ar1 (complement 3a, receptor 1) and serveral other genes were highly correlated to the reconstructed pseudotemporal EndMT process.
